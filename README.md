# GDGoC-Hackathon-Google-2026
In this challenge we use Google’s cutting-edge technology to transform "unconventional" ideas into the "common sense" of the next generation. 
PetFit AI is an AI-powered virtual fitting room for pets.
Users upload a photo of their pet, enter basic measurements (neck, chest, length), and instantly try on different outfits using realistic overlays.

The app recommends the best size for each brand, predicts fit accuracy, and reduces wrong purchases and returns.

PetFit AI combines computer vision, size prediction, and smart recommendations to make pet fashion easier, smarter, and more sustainable.
